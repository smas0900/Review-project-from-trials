        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, <br>thanks to a Depression era
            program known as the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li><b>1935</b>-Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, <br>helping
            starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
          <li><b>1937</b>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
          <li><b>1938</b>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts.<br> Inspired by
            Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman,<br>  who teaches him about breeding
            pest-resistent plants.</li>
          <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,<br> the
            military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
            science.
          </li>
          <li><b>1942</b>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
          <li><b>1944</b>Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, <br>and flies to
            Mexico to head a new plant pathology program Over the next 16 years, <br>his team breeds 6,000 different
            strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
          <li><b>1945 </b> Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
          <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, <br>creating a
            strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li><b>1962</b>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in <br>time
            to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
          <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
          <li><b>1984</b>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
          <li><b>2005</b>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
            modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,<br> as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are
            not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.<br> Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
          <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
